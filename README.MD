## Getting Started

see file "passos" in the main directory

### Prerequisites

All for python3:

* [PyOpenGL](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for python3

No need to say that you'll need [pip3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33906336/where-is-pip3-installing-modules) to install all those things right?

short advice: don't use windows! You're gonna get crazy!
